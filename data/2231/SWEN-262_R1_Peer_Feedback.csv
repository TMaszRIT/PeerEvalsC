Unfortunately got stuck with a few other projects in different classes so I did not add as much as I would have liked to especially with how much there was, however with the limited amount of time, I put in as much work as I could and attended every meeting that we had to catch up on what we were working on.","Thompson,Willow W","5","5","Helped a lot with figuring out the user class and making the uml diagrams so we knew how everything connected. Did a lot of the actual user and history implementation as well and was overall very pleasant to work with. ","Definitely helped making the uml diagrams so we knew what everything did and implementing the user/history class was a huge help too.","Sakowicz,Kevin","5","5","Was a huge help when it came to implementation as he did the personal stock and overall stock with ingredients/recipes/meals. Was also available whenever someone needed, attended all of the meetings, and also helped with serialization/deserialization because we kept running into issues with that.","Contributed a lot with implementation both front and back end and would help other team members if anyone had any questions.","Haag,Alec B","4","5","Could have contributed a little more with the actual implementation, but did do some of the workout class and was very helpful when it came to documentation. ","Did a lot of the documentation which was a huge help and did a good part of the workout class. ","Tseten,Tashi O","4","5","Did a little of the workout class and some of the documentation as well.

Everyone implemented smaller subsystems and I had to connect everything to the front-end while also doing my subsystem. A lot of their code was unnecessary and I had to go in and fix it. I had to also fix a lot of the serialization problems everyone was having. Margaret helped me with problems during the front-end to back-end connection, but everyone else was just there for clarification on certain parts. ","Evarts,Margaret","5","5","Margaret completed her implementation of the goal subsystem and also helped a lot on the implementation when I was having issues understanding certain parts. A lot of her help was in the background which may have been missed by other group members but when it came to clarification on how the logic worked, she was the one to ask.","You did great!","Haag,Alec B","4","5","Alec contributed to the workout subsystem and did most of the presentation. He didn't do a ton on the implementation side of things, but definitely helped when it came to finishing the paperwork aspect. After long nights of coding I would be able to count on him that the paperwork would be complete for the next day.","Great work on the presentations and communication during team meetings.","Tseten,Tashi O","4","5","Tashi was more of a helper during this project meaning that there wasn't one thing that he did, it was more of he helped out on parts of the project. The way our team was setup, we only required 4 people to complete our design and implementation which meant that someone on our team would've been stuck looking for places to contribute. While he never went out of his way to contribute, his help on certain parts such as the workout subsystem or the design diary were helpful.","Great work on the project. Your contributions helped a ton.","Thompson,Willow W","5","5","Willow helped a lot with the overall understanding of how the project will be laid out and how each requirement will connect throughout the whole system. During meetings, they were very good at communicating and would draw out the plans on the whiteboard so everyone would be able to see their thoughts. Willow implemented the user subsystem that needed a lot of refactoring and rewriting to actually work with our program. Their specialty really came into affect when it was time to draw the diagrams for the overall R1 presentation.","Great work on the project.
