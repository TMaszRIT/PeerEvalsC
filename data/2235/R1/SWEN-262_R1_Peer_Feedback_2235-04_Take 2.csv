He truly cares about making a great product, and also making fun and inviting presentations. He contributes great ideas to the team, and we know we can count on him to achieve what he sets out to do.

She cares about producing quality work, and we know we can count on her to get it done. She is also responsive and a good communicator.","Liu,Max",5,5,"Only complaint is Max sometimes agrees to a deadline but doesn't always meet them.

Max cares about contributing to the team, and making a great game. Max does a good job of keeping us on track by asking good questions during meetings. Max always makes it to meetings, and we know that Max will consult the team for ideas when needed.","Noor,Ata",4,5,"It was a bit worrying when Ata missed a couple of our initial meetings, with short or no notice. Fortunately, Ata made up for this by pulling his weight towards the end of R1. Once again, all that would be desired here is more clear communication, and ensuring he is committed to the team.","Ata always asks good questions, and is open to consulting his ideas with the team. He offers great expertise, and we know we can go to him with a technical question or idea and see what he thinks. It was especially appreciated when he took on persistence which he felt the most comfortable with, and knocked out what the team needed in a short period of time despite having multiple commitments. Ata has a busy schedule, so all I would ask is Ata continue to attend our meetings and conversations as best as he can so we can ensure the entire team is on the same page.","Ruan,Sam",5,5,"No real complaints here. The only thing I would say is Sam came to one of our meetings ready to integrate his subsystem, and it became clear that he did not test his work. So the team meeting became more of a debugging/fixing session, something that I wish Sam completed on his own time earlier on.","Sam is attentive, comes to meetings regularly, and asks good questions. Sam pulled his weight in R1. For feedback, Sam could contribute just a bit more in team discussions. If Sam feels unsure of something, he asks the team for help which is great. We talked a bit about this, but Sam just needs to remember to check his work and make sure its ready to go to integrate with the team. I'm glad to have Sam as a team member."
