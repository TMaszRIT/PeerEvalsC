Decided to pick up work the night before part 1 was due, coded the entire user part inside of main instead of creating a class which will cause issues and pushed it to main.

The code I wrote was questionable, however. Luckily my subsystem was the PTUI, which will be entirely replaced in R2.","Mendes,Jack D",1,2,"He did nothing for the project - design or implementation. I gave him a very easy part to do - formatting the output; already given a string or list that would be outputted. He complained about being stressed out and unable to figure out how to possibly get it to work, despite seemingly making no attempt. Later he said he would try to do testing instead of implementation, which he also did not do.",,"Takeuchi,Hiroto",3,2,"Unresponsive on discord during implementation, missed many meetings. Was very difficult to get clarification on how the searching system he created worked. Searching subsystem went unfinished till night before due date, and was buggy. could not integrate with ptui till that night because of lack of communication, and even when we were able it did not work.","Search was probably overcomplicated, and not finishing it till the night of R1 being due doomed the subsystem. Tries to do things too overdesigned to reach some OO goal. Seems to know a lot though, and probably has much more software experience than any other member. Generally pretty nice when it came to working with during implementation. Very helpful during design phase, pointed out possible flaws and designed the data storage structure which ultimately served us well.","Rahman,Syed M",4,4,good!!,"Nice, helpful, was able to accomplish their part without issue. Great help with design, and helped integration of DAO controller and PTUI go very smoothly. Pulled an all nighter the night before our design presentation which ultimately saved our team for that assignment","Mitchell,Joshua Alan",5,5,good!!,"held the team together, carried the majority of the work.
