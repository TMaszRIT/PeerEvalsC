","As a team, we need to focus on scheduling a time for integration and staying in communication.

","Mendes,Jack D","2","2","Wasn't aware of what was going on from the start because he was busy doing other homework instead of contributing to the architecture. As a result he didn't really get included on anything in implementation due to a lack of trust that he understood it and would actually get it done. He was assigned a very small portion of the PTUI to do by Jack S, and he ended up not getting that part done at all either, so we just did it. We told him to pay attention during planning in R2 and we are going to make an effort to assign him stuff to do, but I am still worried about him actually being able to complete it. He definitely needs to have more of a willingness to move on, as the majority of whatever he says is about comparing it to his time the last time he took the course, and usually judging if he can or can't do something based on if it is similar enough to what happened last time.","We already talked about this, but contributing during the planning is crucial so that you are able to be productive during implementation. You have a fresh start, so focus on understanding the architecture that we decide for R2. It is good to draw on your past experience in the course, but stop making that be the reason you can't do something if it's not like last time.

Barely contributes when it comes to filling out any sort of assignment. Unfortunately did not ask for help when struggling to do the csv parser which delayed progress. Has not done any testing for his code even though we agreed as a team we would do that to make sure stuff was working.","Try to speak out during meetings and communicate with others.","Lazari,Oleg","1","1","I do not know where to start. Has skipped multiple meetings, completed wrong requirements in the past. Such as applying the composite pattern to the wrong requirement and then after being told that responded and never actually changed it. Then later when implementing, waited until I reminded him again which was a few days before we agreed to have the subsystems finished. Also, I do not think he has contributed at all to the documents we have turned in other than what he was required to do individually, such as describe his subsystem, etc. Has contacted me multiple times asking to review his code in which I have found incomplete requirements and incorrect implementations. Which could be solved by reading the instructions. Also copies and pastes code too much without actually understanding what it means. Have had to remove not needed functions from his code because he copied and pasted code that was similar but not exact. Which once again would be solved by reading the instructions. Was up all night the day before the assignment was due because he brushed off my warning about the due date and his work.
