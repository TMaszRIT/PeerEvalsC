He offers great expertise, and we know we can go to him with a technical question or idea and see what he thinks. It was especially appreciated when he took on persistence which he felt the most comfortable with, and knocked out what the team needed in a short period of time despite having multiple commitments.

The only thing I would say is Sam came to one of our meetings ready to integrate his subsystem, and it became clear that he did not test his work.

Sam pulled his weight in R1. For feedback, Sam could contribute just a bit more in team discussions. If Sam feels unsure of something, he asks the team for help which is great. We talked a bit about this, but Sam just needs to remember to check his work and make sure its ready to go to integrate with the team. I'm glad to have Sam as a team member."
